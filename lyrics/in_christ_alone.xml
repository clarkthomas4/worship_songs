    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe.
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain:
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c4">
      <lines>No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.</lines>
    </verse>
