    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
		In Christ alone my hope is found,<br />
		He is my light, my strength, my song<br />
		This Cornerstone, this solid Ground<br />
		Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>		
		What heights of love, what depths of peace<br />
		When fears are stilled, when strivings cease<br />
		My Comforter, my All in All<br />
		Here in the love of Christ I stand.<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>		
		In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,<br />
		Fullness of God in helpless babe.<br />
		This gift of love and righteousness,<br />
		Scorned by the ones He came to save<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>
		Till on that cross as Jesus died,<br />
		The wrath of God was satisfied <br />
		For every sin on Him was laid<br />
		Here in the death of Christ I live.<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
		There in the ground His body lay,<br />
		Light of the world by darkness slain:<br />
		Then bursting forth in glorious day<br />
		Up from the grave He rose again<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>
		And as He stands in victory<br />
		Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,<br />
		For I am His and He is mine <br />
		Bought with the precious blood of Christ<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
		No guilt in life, no fear in death,<br />
		This is the power of Christ in me<br />
		From life's first cry to final breath,<br />
		Jesus commands my destiny<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c4">
      <lines>
		No power of hell, no scheme of man,<br />
		Can ever pluck me from His hand<br />
		Till He returns or calls me home<br />
		Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.<br />
	  </lines>
