    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
		Before the throne of God above<br />
		I have a strong and perfect plea <br />
		A great High Priest whose name is love <br />
		Who ever lives and pleads for me <br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>	
		My name is graven on His hands <br />
		My name is written on His heart <br />
		I know that while in heav'n He stands <br />
		No tongue can bid me thence depart <br />
		No tongue can bid me thence depart<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>	
		When Satan tempts me to despair <br />
		And tells me of the guilt within <br />
		Upward I look and see Him there <br />
		Who made an end of all my sin <br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>	
		Because the sinless Savior died <br />
		My sinful soul is counted free <br />
		For God the Just is satisfied <br />
		To look on Him and pardon me <br />
		To look on Him and pardon me<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>	
		Behold Him there, the risen Lamb <br />
		My perfect, spotless Righteousness <br />
		The great unchangeable I AM <br />
		The King of glory and of grace <br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>	
		One with Himself, I cannot die <br />
		My soul is purchased by His blood <br />
		My life is hid with Christ on high <br />
		With Christ my Savior and my God <br />
		With Christ my Savior and my God<br />
		With Christ my Savior and my God<br />
