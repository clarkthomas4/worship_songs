    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea 
A great High Priest whose name is love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>My name is graven on His hands 
My name is written on His heart 
I know that while in heav'n He stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart 
No tongue can bid me thence depart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upward I look and see Him there 
Who made an end of all my sin</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Because the sinless Savior died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the Just is satisfied 
To look on Him and pardon me 
To look on Him and pardon me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Behold Him there, the risen Lamb 
My perfect, spotless Righteousness 
The great unchangeable I AM 
The King of glory and of grace</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>One with Himself, I cannot die 
My soul is purchased by His blood 
My life is hid with Christ on high 
With Christ my Savior and my God 
With Christ my Savior and my God
With Christ my Savior and my God</lines>
    </verse>
