    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold the man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom</lines>
    </verse>
