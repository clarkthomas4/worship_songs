    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
		How deep the Father's love for us<br />
		How vast beyond all measure<br />
		That He should give His only Son<br />
		To make a wretch His treasure<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>	
		How great the pain of searing loss<br />
		The Father turns His face away<br />
		As wounds which mar the Chosen One<br />
		Bring many sons to glory<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>	
		Behold the man upon a cross<br />
		My sin upon His shoulders<br />
		Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice<br />
		Call out among the scoffers<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>	
		It was my sin that held Him there<br />
		Until it was accomplished<br />
		His dying breath has brought me life<br />
		I know that it is finished<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>	
		I will not boast in anything<br />
		No gifts, no power, no wisdom<br />
		But I will boast in Jesus Christ<br />
		His death and resurrection<br />
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="c3">
      <lines>	
		Why should I gain from His reward?
		I cannot give an answer
		But this I know with all my heart
		His wounds have paid my ransom
	  </lines>
	</verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>	
		Why should I gain from His reward?
		I cannot give an answer
		But this I know with all my heart
		His wounds have paid my ransom
