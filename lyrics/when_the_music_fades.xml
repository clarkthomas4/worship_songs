    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless your heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p">
      <lines>I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c">
      <lines>I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours
Every single breath</lines>
    </verse>
