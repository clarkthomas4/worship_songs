    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There were walls between us
And by the cross you came and broke them down
You broke them down</lines>
      <lines>And there were chains around us
By Your grace we are no longer bound
No longer bound</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p">
      <lines>You called me out of the grave
You called me into the light
You called my name and then my heart came alive</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c">
      <lines>Your love is greater
Your love is stronger
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Feel the darkness shaking
All the dead are coming back to life
Back to life</lines>
      <lines>Hear the song awaken
All creation singing we're alive
'Cause You're alive</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b">
      <lines>And what a love we found
Death can't hold us down
We shout it out we're alive, 'cause you're alive</lines>
    </verse>
