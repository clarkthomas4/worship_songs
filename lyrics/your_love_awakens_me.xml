    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
        There were walls between us<br />
        And by the cross you came and broke them down<br />
        You broke them down<br />
      </lines>
      <lines>
        And there were chains around us<br />
        By Your grace we are no longer bound<br />
        No longer bound<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p">
      <lines>
        You called me out of the grave<br />
        You called me into the light<br />
        You called my name and then my heart came alive<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c">
      <lines>
        Your love is greater<br />
        Your love is stronger<br />
        Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
        Feel the darkness shaking<br />
        All the dead are coming back to life<br />
        Back to life<br />
      </lines>
      <lines>
        Hear the song awaken<br />
        All creation singing we're alive<br />
        'Cause You're alive<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b">
      <lines>
        And what a love we found<br />
        Death can't hold us down<br />
        We shout it out we're alive, 'cause you're alive<br />
      </lines>
