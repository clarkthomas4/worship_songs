    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
The King of Glory, the King above all kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
The King of Glory, the King above all kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c">
      <lines>This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross</lines>
      <lines>You would lay down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who brings our chaos back into order
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
The King of Glory, the King of Glory</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of Glory, the King above all kings</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b">
      <lines>Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave (x3)
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King</lines>
