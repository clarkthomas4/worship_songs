    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
        Who breaks the power of sin and darkness<br />
        Whose love is mighty and so much stronger<br />
        The King of Glory, the King above all kings<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
        Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder<br />
        And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder<br />
        The King of Glory, the King above all kings<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c">
      <lines>
        This is amazing grace<br />
        This is unfailing love<br />
        That You would take my place<br />
        That You would bear my cross<br />
      </lines>
      <lines>
        You would lay down Your life<br />
        That I would be set free<br />
        Oh, Jesus, I sing for<br />
        All that You've done for me<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
        Who brings our chaos back into order<br />
        Who makes the orphan a son and daughter<br />
        The King of Glory, the King of Glory<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>
        Who rules the nations with truth and justice<br />
        Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance<br />
        The King of Glory, the King above all kings<br />
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b">
      <lines>
        Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br />
        Worthy is the King who conquered the grave (x3)<br />
        Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br />
        Worthy is the King<br />
