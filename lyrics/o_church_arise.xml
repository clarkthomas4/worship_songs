      <verse name="v1">
         <lines>O church, arise and put your armour on;
Hear the call of Christ our captain;
For now the weak can say that they are strong
In the strength that God has given.</lines>
         <lines>With shield of faith and belt of truth
We'll stand against the devil's lies;
An army bold whose battle cry is "Love!"
Reaching out to those in darkness.</lines>
      </verse>
      <verse name="v2">
         <lines>Our call to war, to love the captive soul,
But to rage against the captor;
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole
We will fight with faith and valour.</lines>
         <lines>When faced with trials on ev'ry side,
We know the outcome is secure,
And Christ will have the prize for which He diedâ€”
An inheritance of nations.</lines>
      </verse>
      <verse name="c">
         <lines>Arise, shine for your light has come.
Arise, shine for the Risen Son.
Lift your eyes, we are his radiant bride
Arise, O church, arise</lines>
      </verse>
      <verse name="v3">
         <lines>Come, see the cross where love and mercy meet,
As the Son of God is stricken;
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,
For the Conqueror has risen!</lines>
         <lines>And as the stone is rolled away,
And Christ emerges from the grave,
This vict'ry march continues till the day
Ev'ry eye and heart shall see Him.</lines>
      </verse>
      <verse name="v4">
         <lines>So Spirit, come, put strength in ev'ry stride,
Give grace for ev'ry hurdle,
That we may run with faith to win the prize
Of a servant good and faithful.</lines>
         <lines>As saints of old still line the way,
Retelling triumphs of His grace,
We hear their calls and hunger for the day
When, with Christ, we stand in glory.</lines>
