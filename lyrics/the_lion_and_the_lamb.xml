    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He's coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms will bow down
And every chain will break, as broken hearts declare His praise
Who can stop the Lord Almighty?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah
He's roaring with power and fighting our battles
And every knee will bow before You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain
For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains
And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
Oh every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So open up the gates, make way before the King of kings
Our God who calls the saved is here to set the captives free
Who can stop the Lord Almighty?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b">
      <lines>Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
Who can stop the Lord?</lines>
    </verse>
